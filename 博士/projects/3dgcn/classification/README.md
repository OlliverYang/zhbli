Model structure for classification

## Dataset
ModelNet is used for classification task, and detail description can be found on the [official website](http://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/). Dataset ModelNet40 containing 40 object categories can be downloaded for experiments by running:
```
bash download.sh
```
Mesh objects are contained in `ModelNet40`. Point cloud dataset can be generated by running:
```
python3 sample_points.py \
-source ModelNet40 -target [path] -point_num 1024
```
1024 points are sampled from each object surface, and all point cloud objects are contained in `[path]`. Objects can be normalized (zero-mean, unit size) by adding argument `-normal`.

## Hyper-parameters
Descriptions of all hyper parameters are shown by running:
```
python3 main.py -h
```
Default values are speciifed in `main.py`.

## Training 
To train GCN3D, please **add/remove/edit** hyper parameters in `train.sh` (e.g. point cloud dataset for `-dataset` argument), and run: 
```
bash train.sh
```

## Testing
After training, please **add/remove/edit** hyper parameters in `test.sh`, and run the evaluation:
```
bash test.sh
```
which would show:
```
Test Loss: *****
Test Acc:  *****
```

## Notifications
* Experiments on other model ([PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593)/[DGCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829)) can be run by edit `-model` argument, note that for such model, `-normal` should be added.
* When testing, object transformation can be added by editing `-shift`, `-scale`, `-rotate`, `-random`. Compared with pervious works, 3D-GCN is **shift- and scale-invariant** and less sensitive to rotation, which is much more robust.
