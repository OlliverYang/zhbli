## GOT-10k

The GOT-10k testing set includes 180 sequences with 84 different object classes and 32 motion patterns.

There is no overlap in object classes between the train and test splits, promoting the importance of generalization to unseen object classes.

## OTB

OTB-2015 is one of the most commonly used benchmarks for visual object tracking.

The OTB2015 dataset is the most popular benchmark dataset that most trackers are evaluated on. The dataset includes 100 sequences of various tracking scenarios.

As one of the most classical benchmarks for the object tracking task, the OTB benchmark (Wu, Lim, and Yang 2013) provides a fair test for all families of trackers.

OTB-2013 firstly contributes a testing dataset 2 by collecting 51 videos with manually annotated bounding box in each frame. The sequences are labeled with different attributes for further analysis of tracking performance.

## TrackingNet

TrackingNet contains 30000 sequences  with 14 million dense annotations and 511 sequences in the  test set. It covers diverse object classes and scenes, requiring trackers to have both discriminative and generative capabilities.
