**Two fundamental problems** are critical for person re-identification, **feature representation** and **metric learning**.

# 1. Introduction

In this paper, we propose an **effective feature representation** called Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), and a subspace and metric learning method called Cross-view  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA).
