## Abstract

We are aware of those parts of a cat that are occluded behind a fence. The question is how we represent these occluded parts of perceived objects: this is the problem of **amodal perception**.

## Introduction

Suppose that I am looking at a cat behind a picket fence, but the cat’s tail is not  visible, because it is occluded by one of the pickets. The question is how I represent the cat’s tail? Do I see it? Do I have a non-perceptual belief about it? This problem is sometimes referred to as the problem of **amodal perception** and sometimes it is called the puzzle of perceptual presence.

Almost all episodes of perception include an **amodal component**. **For example, typically, only three sides of a non-transparent cube are visible. The other three are not  visible – we are aware of them ‘amodally’**.
