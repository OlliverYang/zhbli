# 收费

After a manuscript has been accepted for publication, the author’s institution will be approached with a request to pay a voluntary charge of $110 per page to cover part of the cost of publication. If the voluntary page charge is not honored, IEEE will charge a mandatory page charge of $175 per page for each page in excess of nine (9) for a TRANSACTIONS PAPER paper or in excess of five (5) for a TRANSACTIONS PAPER letter. The author will receive 100 free reprints (without cover) only if the voluntary page charge is honored. Detailed instructions will accompany the page proofs. Color photos judged to be essential to show the results of a paper may be printed in color. The cost of printing color photos will be shared by the author(s) and the Society.

Over-length charges begin with the 10th page.
