\maketitle

\noindent Dear Editors:

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you and the reviewers for the insightful and helpful comments. When we revised the paper, we carefully considered and followed all the comments and suggestions provided by you and the reviewers. To summarize, we have made the following revisions:

(1) We have added the advantages \& limitations of the proposed method after experimental analysis and the future work to the conclusion.

(2) We have carefully considered and followed all the comments and suggestions related to the clarity of the writing, and made the new material a thoroughly revised manuscript.

(3) We have added 3 papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, which are most closely related to our manuscript, and analysed what is distinctive / new about our current manuscript related to these previously published papers.

\uline{
Research topics related to adversarial attacks includes digital watermarking \cite{9343885}, 3D face presentation attacks \cite{9303455} and adversarial defense \cite{9169672}.
Xiong et. al. \cite{9343885} generate digital watermarking by slightly modifying the pixel values of videos frame to protect video content from unauthorized access. Compared with \cite{9343885}, our purpose of modifying pixel values of video frames is attacking the tracker, instead of detecting the illegal distribution of a digital movie.
Jia et. al. \cite{9294085} generate 3D face artifacts to fool the face recognition system. Compared with \cite{9294085}, our method directly modifies the input of the network instead of changing the input of cameras using 3D face artifacts.
Wang et. al. \cite{9169672} propose white-box attack/defense methods for image classifiers. Compared with \cite{9169672}, we focus on attacking the object tracking networks instead of the image classification networks.

\newpage
\textit{This paper addresses the task of attacking Siamese network-based trackers in a simple yet effective fashion. Unlike other methods that operate in the video-specific attacking regime (which resides on network inference for generating perturbations while tracking), this method is the first to perform universal targeted attacks for Siamese trackers utilizing both the translucent perturbation and the adversarial patch together. By adding the perturbation to the template and adding the patch to the search image while performing tracking, this work fools the Siamese trackers to the fake target region and thus makes them fail in tracking the real target object. Overall, this is an interesting paper, and it is well written and organized. As it is a resubmitted manuscript, I notice that the authors have made substantial changes to the previous manuscript, which are able to appropriately respond to the comments made by the previous reviewers. Although the template perturbation and adversarial patch are both easy to observe for human eyes as the previous reviewers have pointed out, and the SSIMs for them are also lower than the video-specific attacking method, e.g., FAN \cite{FAN}, this reviewer believes that this proposed new framework can be a new configuration of adversarial attack on visual tracking for its achieved balance between the attack efficiency and the perturbation perceptibility. This new configuration will attract increasing attention from the visual tracking attack community to study on more efficient attack methods.}

\textbf{Many thanks for your positive comments on the strength of our paper and thenovelty of the proposed attack method.}

%%%% 问题 1.1 %%%%
\textit{In addition, I suggest the authors add more experiments to demonstrate the practicability of the attack method when the ground truth box information is missing in the training data. The experimental results show that it is effective to use the predicted boxes instead of ground truth boxes for training perturbations.}

\textbf{This question needs to be discussed with Jin Gao.}

%%%% 问题 1.2 %%%%
\textit{A small question is that it will be better if the authors can provide some pseudo code for the untargeted attack and targeted attack processes in addition to the training process. This will facilitate the understanding of the attacking process while performing tracking.}

\begin{algorithm}[tb]
    \caption{Attack Process}
    \label{alg:algorithm_attack}
    \textbf{Input}: The trained perturbations $\delta$ and $p$, Siamese tracker $f$, video $V=\{I_i\}_1^T$. $b^{gt}_1$ is the position of the real target in the first frame. $B^{fake}=\{b^{fake}_i\}_1^{T}$ is the trajectory we hope the tracker to output.\\
    \textbf{Output}: $B^{pred}=\{b^{pred}_i\}_1^{T}$
    \begin{algorithmic}[1] %[1] enables line numbers
      \STATE Generate the clean template image $\textbf{z}_1$ according to $I_1$ and $b^{gt}_1$.
      \STATE Generate the perturbed template image $\tilde{\textbf z}_1=\textbf z_1+\delta$.
      \STATE Let $i = 2$.
    \WHILE{$i \le T$}
    \STATE Generate clean search image $\textbf{x}_i$ according to $I_i$ and $b^{pred}_{i-1}$.
    \STATE $b^{fake}_i=\{x_{0_i}, y_{0_i}, x_{1_i}, y_{1_i}\}$
    \STATE Generate the perturbed search image $\tilde{\textbf x}_i = A_{\text{add}}(\textbf x_i, p, \{x_{0_i}, y_{0_i}, x_{1_i}, y_{1_i}\}).$
    \STATE $\textbf{C, R, Q} = f(\tilde {\textbf x}_i, \tilde{\textbf z}_1).$
    \STATE Generate the predicted bounding box $b^{pred}_i$ according to $\textbf{C, R, Q}$.
    \STATE $i = i + 1.$
    \ENDWHILE
    \STATE \textbf{return} $B^{pred}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Both the targeted attack and untargeted attack process follow the same steps as shown in Alg. \ref{alg:algorithm_attack}. The difference between the target attack and the untargeted attack is the evaluation. For the targeted attack, we compare the AO between $B^{pred}=\{b^{pred}_i\}_1^{T}$ and $B^{fake}=\{b^{fake}_i\}_1^{T}$. For the untargeted attack, we compare the AO between $B^{pred}=\{b^{pred}_i\}_1^{T}$ and $B^{gt}=\{b^{gt}_i\}_1^{T}$.}

\textit{In this paper, the authors train a universal adversarial patch to add on both template and search regions of a Siamese based tracker to deteriorate its original performance. The proposed perturbations are video-agnostic, leading to a low computational cost during attack. The experiment validations show that the proposed method achieves favorable attack results on OTB2015, GOT-10k, LaSOT, UAV123, VOT2016, VOT2018 and VOT2019. In addition, the generated perturbations transfer well on other Siamese trackers as well. The idea of this paper is interesting and the experiments are thorough.}

\textbf{Many thanks for your positive comments on the strength of our paper and the novelty of the proposed attack method.}

%%%% 问题 2.1 %%%%
\textit{However, there are some concerns over the implementation, performance and writing. 1. The authors state that training with Ep. 4 leads to an obvious patch on the images while using Eq.5 into the training process results in a less obvious patch. The reviewer considers that giving a constraint (e.g. $l_{\infty}$) on the $p_x$ in Eq.4 can make the perturbation imperceptible intuitively. Please give more analysis on this setting.
Besides, the reviewer hopes to know the reason why give an extra perturbation on the template region. The perturbations on template and search regions look similar, while the authors say that they are different. Please state the difference between the patch application operator on search examples and the operator on template examples.
In addition, the denotations of $A_{paste}$ in Eq.4 and $A_{add}$ in Eq.5 seem like the same one.
}

\textbf{
Thanks for the good comment.
Before analysis if giving constraint (e.g. $L_{\infty}$) on the $p_x$ in Eq.4 is really lead to imperceptible or not, let us first clarify the concept of the $A_{paste}$ and $A_{add}$, which is not tell good in the previous manuscript.}

\textbf{% 解释paste（说明不需要加 constraint）
$A_{paste}$ means that,
% we use the pixel value in in every place of the perturbation to replace the original image pixel value at the corresponding position.
% The final pixel value is changed from the original value to a new value.
in the region where the perturbation is pasted, the pixel values of the original image is replaced with the pixel values of the perturbation.
% 说明加了约束也没用。
% As a result, even though we add constraint to the perturbation and it is small, when we paste it to the image, it shows nearly black but not imperceptible.
Thus, even if we add constraints to the patch so that the perturbation values are small, when the patch is pasted to the image, it will look like an almost black region, which is obvious rather than imperceptible.
}

% 解释加法
\textbf{
The operator $A_{add}$ means to apply additive noise, where the injecting small perturbations into the image. Often need constraint. the injected noise are small and sometimes invisible. If we add a patch onto the image, the final pixel value is the original value plus a new value.}

\textbf{The operator $A_{\text{add}}(\textbf{x}, p_\textbf{x}, b^{fake}_{\textbf{x}})$ and $\textbf{z} + \delta_\textbf{z}$ is similar. The only difference is that, $A_{\text{add}}$ means add the perturbation to a specific region because the patch size is less than the image, while $+$ means add the perturbation to the full image because the size is the same.}

\textbf{For your convenience of cross checking, the new added text is shown as follows:}

\uline{
$A_{paste}$ means that, in the region where the perturbation is pasted, the pixel values of the original image is replaced with the pixel values of the perturbation.
% 解释加法
The operator $A_{add}$ means to apply additive noise, where the injecting small perturbations into the input samples. Often need constraint. the injected noise are small and sometimes invisible.

%%%% 问题 2.2 %%%%
\textit{2. I agree with reviewer 3, the ground truth boxes are inaccessible to trackers during the inference. It seems that the authors use the ground truth boxes to generate the fake trajectory in lines 51-57 on page 7. Please clarify it.}

\textbf{We generate new trajectory without the test GT: we let the fake box run straight to border of the image, speed and derection is random. For your convenience in cross-checking, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{\textit{Ablation Study: An alternative way to generate the fake trajectory}  Here, we consider an alternative way to generate the \textit{fake trajectory}. Specifically, the attacker forces the tracker to follow a fixed direction. We illustrate this with 4 different directions, consisting of shifting the box by $(\pm 3, \pm 3)$ pixels in each consecutive frames, corresponding to the four directions $45^{\circ}, -45^{\circ}, 135^{\circ}, -135^{\circ}$.}

\textit{3. For the experiments, the authors should conduct the ablation study on only adding perturbations on the template images or the search regions to show the impact of $p$ and $\delta$.}

\textbf{Thanks for your advice and we have conducted the ablation study on only adding perturbations on the template images or the search regions to show the impact of $p$ and $\delta$. As we can see, only use one of them is not useful, because they are trained together. For your convenience of cross review, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{\textit{One Branch Attack} To see the impact of $p$ and $\delta$, we add the ablation study on only adding perturbations on the template images or the search regions. The result is shown in table \ref{table:one_branch}. Experiment results shows that only adding the perturbation to one branch is not useful.
% 对比无目标攻击性能。
For the untargeted attack, only attacking the template/search branch leads to the AO of 0.510/0.714, while attacking both branches leads to the AO of 0.153, which is more effective.
% 有目标
For the targeted attack, only attacking the templat/search branch leads to the AO of 0.156/0.160, while attacking both branches leads to the AO of 0.840. Experimental results show that attacking two branches can achieve better results than attacking one branch.}

%%%% 问题 3.1 %%%%
\textit{This paper employs the universal perturbation attacks on Siamese visual trackers. There are still the following concerns about the proposed method. 1. As stated in the paper, the proposed method ``does not require gradient optimization or network inference". However, this is a double-edged sword since it resulted in suspicious attacks. Prior works commonly train a network to prevent not only suspicious attacks but also modifying every pixel. I think it's a major problem with this work. I suggest considering a proper strategy to remove/reduce it.}

\textit{2. The proposed method and offline training phase should be explained more clearly. For instance, the termination of offline training or offline optimization is missed affecting perturbation values.}

\textbf{Thanks for the good comment. For your convenience in cross-checking, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{Before introducing the proposed method, we first revisit the popular adversarial example generation methods. One of the simplest methods to generate adversarial images $I^{adv}$ works by linearizing loss function in $L_{\infty}$ neighbourhood of a clean image and finds exact maximum of linearized function using following closed-form equation \cite{FGSM}:}
\begin{equation}
    I^{adv} = I + \epsilon \cdot \text{ sign} \bigl( \nabla_I L(I, y_{true})  \bigr),
    \vspace{-0.1cm}
\end{equation}
\uline{where $I$ is the input image, and the values of the pixels are integer numbers in the range [0, 255]. $y_{true}$ is the true label for the image $I$. $L(I, y)$ is the cost function of the neural network for the attack purpose, given image $I$ and label $y$. $\epsilon$ is a hyper-parameter to be chosen. A straightforward way to extend the above method is applying it multiple times with small step size, and clipping pixel values of intermediate results after each step to ensure that they are in an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the original image.  This leads to the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) introduced in \cite{kurakin2017adversarial}:}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
        I_0^{adv} = I, \\
        I_{N+1}^{adv} = I_N^{adv}+\epsilon \cdot \text{ sign}(\nabla_I L(I_N^{adv},y_{true})),
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
%\uline{where $Clip_{I, \epsilon} \left\{ I' \right\}$ is the function which performs per-pixel clipping of the image $I'$, so that the result will be in $L_{\infty}$ $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the source image $I$.}
\uline{The BIM can be easily made into an attacker for a specific desired target class, called the Iterative Target Class Method \cite{kurakin2017adversarial}:}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
      I_0^{adv} = I,\\
      I_{N+1}^{adv} = I_N^{adv}-\epsilon \cdot \text{ sign}(\nabla_I L(I_N^{adv},y_{target})).
  \end{gathered}
  \label{equ:itcm}
\end{equation}

\uline{We extend the Iterative Target Class Method by performing an update at each step of the training:}

\begin{gather}
  \delta_{k+1} = \delta_{k} - \epsilon_1 \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_{\delta_k}L)\\
  p_{k+1} = p_{k} - \epsilon_2 \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_{p_k}L),
  \end{gather}

\textbf{Thanks for the good commenet. As suggested, we have added the advantages \& limitations of the proposed method after experimental analysis and future works to the conclusion. For your convenience in cross-checking, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{
Compared with other attack method, our method has two key advantages. First,
  % 通用的，也就是不需要进行网络推断或者梯度计算，因此使得可以在不消耗计算资源的同时执行攻击成为可能。
because our video-agnostic feature, we are fast, no need to network interferes or gradient calculation, making it possible to attack a real-world online-tracking system when we can not get access to the limited computational resources.
Second, the proposed perturbations show good transferability to other anchor free or anchor based trackers. 
  %(1) Physical attack. We are the digital attack, which means ... Physical attack is ... The advantage of it is ... Our work assumes a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as input.
  % 这不就是 ICCV2019 的工作吗？它们也通用？好像是。EOT是通用的吗？
The main limitation of our work is the values of our universal perturbations are not as small as other non-universal perturbations due to the task difficulty.
% Future work:
  % (1) We need to do the physical attack.
  % (2) We need to be imperceptible.
  % 使用同一个扰动同时攻击多个视觉任务，包括图像分类，检测，视频目标跟踪和分割。
  In future work, we expect that it will be possible to demonstrate the existence of a single perturbation to attack multi vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and video object tracking/segementation.
  % 以更小的扰动取得更高的攻击效果。（呼应缺点之：扰动大）
  % Use more imperceptible perturbations to achieve high attack performance.
  % 本文所提出的对抗性信息被添加在数字图像上，从而影响跟踪器的跟踪效果。然而所提出的对抗性信息难以用于执行孪生跟踪器的物理攻击，即将对抗扰动打印出来添加到物理世界的真实目标上，从而影响孪生跟踪系统的性能。因为对抗扰动的打印过程可能改变扰动的值，且相机传感器可能无法感知较小的扰动。可能的解决方案是借助EOT生成针对相机距离和角度具有鲁棒性的物理扰动，使得在各种成像条件下，跟踪系统都无法对带有对抗性信息的真实目标进行正确跟踪。

\textit{This paper proposes a universal targeted attacks method on Siamese visual tracking task. It seems that the method is feasible and somewhat novel.}

\textbf{Many thanks for your positive comments on the strength of our paper and the novelty of the proposed attack method.}

\textit{My major concern is that the writing and organization need to be carefully modified and optimized. Besides, 1. Authors are focused on the anchor-free tracker in the experiments, but the anchor-free Siamese trackers are not well mentioned. I suggest the authors to include the discussion of state-of-the-art of other similar approaches (e.g., FCOT, SiamCAR, OCEAN, et. al.).}

\textbf{We have discussed several state-of-the-art anchor free Siamese trackers at the related work. For your convenience of cross review, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{
% Ocean
Ocean \cite{zhang2020ocean} directly predicts the position and scale of target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in groundtruth boxes is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying inexact predictions of target objects during inference.
% FCOT
FCOT \cite{cui2020fully} introduces an online regression model generator (RMG) based on the carefully designed anchor-free box regression branch, which enables the tracker to be more effective in handling target deformation during tracking procedure.
%  SiamCAR
SiamCAR \cite{9157720} is both proposal and anchor free, and decomposes tracking into two subproblems: one classification problem and one regression task. SiamCAR takes one unique response map to predict object location and bounding box directly.
}

\textbf{Besides, we have evaluated the transferability to the anchor free tracker OCEAN in Setcion IV.E of the revised manuscript. For your convenience of cross review, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{We evaluate the transferability to Ocean on OTB2015 in terms of success. As shown in table \ref{tab:arch}, the tracking performance drops form 0.902 to 0.282.}

\begin{table}[t!]

  \caption{Transferability to different tracking architectures on OTB2015. The original perturbations are trained on SiamFC++\_GoogleNet, then we directly apply the perturbations to two more state-of-the-art anchor-based trackers: AlexNet-based SiamRPN \cite{SiamRPN} and ResNet-based SiamRPN++ \cite{SiamRPN++}.}

\textit{2. The model is trained based on Eq.11 and Eq.12. It is not clear why the sign function is introduced. It is also suggested to describe the derivation of these two equations in detail.}

\textbf{Thanks for the good comment. For your convenience in cross-checking, the new text is given as follows.}

\uline{Before introducing the proposed method, we first revisit the popular adversarial example generation methods. One of the simplest methods to generate adversarial images $I^{adv}$ works by linearizing loss function in $L_{\infty}$ neighbourhood of a clean image and finds exact maximum of linearized function using following closed-form equation \cite{FGSM}:}
\begin{equation}
    I^{adv} = I + \epsilon \cdot \text{ sign} \bigl( \nabla_I L(I, y_{true})  \bigr),
    \vspace{-0.1cm}
\end{equation}
\uline{where $I$ is the input image, and the values of the pixels are integer numbers in the range [0, 255]. $y_{true}$ is the true label for the image $I$. $L(I, y)$ is the cost function of the neural network for the attack purpose, given image $I$ and label $y$. $\epsilon$ is a hyper-parameter to be chosen. A straightforward way to extend the above method is applying it multiple times with small step size, and clipping pixel values of intermediate results after each step to ensure that they are in an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the original image.  This leads to the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) introduced in \cite{kurakin2017adversarial}:}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
        I_0^{adv} = I, \\
        I_{N+1}^{adv} = I_N^{adv}+\epsilon \cdot \text{ sign}(\nabla_I L(I_N^{adv},y_{true})),
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
%\uline{where $Clip_{I, \epsilon} \left\{ I' \right\}$ is the function which performs per-pixel clipping of the image $I'$, so that the result will be in $L_{\infty}$ $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the source image $I$.}
\uline{The BIM can be easily made into an attacker for a specific desired target class, called the Iterative Target Class Method \cite{kurakin2017adversarial}:}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
      I_0^{adv} = I,\\
      I_{N+1}^{adv} = I_N^{adv}-\epsilon \cdot \text{ sign}(\nabla_I L(I_N^{adv},y_{target})).
  \end{gathered}
  \label{equ:itcm}
\end{equation}

\uline{We extend the Iterative Target Class Method by performing an update at each step of the training:}

\begin{gather}
  \delta_{k+1} = \delta_{k} - \epsilon_1 \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_{\delta_k}L)\\
  p_{k+1} = p_{k} - \epsilon_2 \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_{p_k}L),
\end{gather}


\textit{3. The format of all the Tables is suggested to be unified.}

\textbf{Thanks for the good comment. We have unified the format of all the tables.}

\textit{4. There are many typos in the paper, including but not limited to the following errors:}

\textit{(a) In the third line below Eq.7, $A_{a}dd$ should be $A_{add}$.}

\textit{(b) In page 2, difference datasets GOT-10K[12], LaSOT \cite{LaSOT} cite the same reference.}
